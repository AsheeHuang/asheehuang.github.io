I am a `Senior Software Engineer` with five years of experience at Synology, specializing in `High Availability (HA) solutions` and `Linux system development`. My expertise includes `Active-Passive` and `Active-Active` architectures, `file-level to block-level synchronization and backup mechanisms`, and `C/C++ system programming` for high-performance and reliable software solutions.

Currently, I am taking a `gap year` to further enhance my skills while remaining open to new career opportunities. I am always eager to explore challenges in `system development`, `high-availability architectures`, and `storage technologies`.

I am passionate about life and constantly push myself beyond my limits. Whether in my professional career or personal pursuits, I thrive on challenges and continuous growth.

Letâ€™s connect and discuss potential collaborations!

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
